#A Simple Demo for UIStackView

UIStackView is first introduced in iOS 9. The stack view provides a streamlined interface for laying out a collection of views in either a column or a row. For views embedded in a stack view, you no longer need to define auto layout constraints. The stack view manages the layout of its subviews and automatically applies layout constrants for you. That means, the subviews are ready to adapt to different screen sizes. Furthermore, you can embed a stack view in another stack view to build more complex user interfaces. Don’t get me wrong. It doesn’t mean you do not need to deal with auto layout. You still need to define the layout constrants for the stack view. It just saves you time from creating constraints for every UI element and makes it super easy to add/remove views from the layout.
